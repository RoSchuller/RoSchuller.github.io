Biography
======

Robert Schuller received his M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2020. In the same year, he joined the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a research scientist. His research focuses on motion planning and control, particularly in the context of humanoid robotics and legged locomotion.

	Gait generation frameworks for humanoid robots typically assume a constant centroidal angular momentum &#40;CAM&#41; throughout the walking cycle, which induces undesirable contact torques in the feet and results in performance degradation. In this work, we present a novel algorithm to learn the CAM online and include the obtained knowledge within the closed-form solutions of the Divergent Component of Motion &#40;DCM&#41; locomotion framework. To ensure a reduction of the contact torques at the desired center of pressure position, a CAM trajectory is generated and explicitly tracked by a wholebody controller.&nbsp;</p>

	This video presents a push recovery algorithm for humanoid robots in balancing scenarios by exploiting the system&rsquo;s rotational dynamics. The robot actively generates centroidal angular momentum &#40;CAM&#41; references based on the force magnitude and direction of the push to counteract the disturbance and maintain its balance.</p>
